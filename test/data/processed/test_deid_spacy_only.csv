Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. [REDACTED],
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove [REDACTED] from your belly. We 
also placed you on you [REDACTED] of Lasix and [REDACTED] of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications [REDACTED] to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
[REDACTED] in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your [REDACTED] Team.

IMAGING:
[REDACTED] CXR- No acute cardiopulmonary abnormality.  
06/27/2180 RUQ US-  
1. Extremely coarse and nodular liver echotexture consistent 
with a history of cirrhosis.  
[REDACTED]. Moderate ascites.  
[REDACTED]. Patent portal vein.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
[REDACTED] female with HIV on HAART, HCV cirrhosis with ascites and HE, h/o 
IVDU, COPD, bipolar disorder presents with abdominal discomfort 
due to recurrent ascites.  
 
# ASCITES. Now diuretic refractory given last tap was [REDACTED]ago with 3L removed and she has already built up moderate 
ascites. Infectious workup negative, with CXR clear, UA 
contaminated but not grossly positive so will f/u culture, 
diagnostic para with only 225 WBC, RUQ US with no PV thrombus. 
Compliant with diuretics but not following low sodium diet or 
fluid restriction. Dr. [REDACTED] discussed possible TIPS in 
the office but due to lung disease, that was on hold pending 
further cardiac evaluation. Diuretics were recently decreased 
due to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Held spironolactone for 
now due to K [REDACTED] and increased lasix 20 -> [REDACTED]. No evidence of 
severe hyponatremia (Na<120) or renal failure Cr>2.0 to stop 
diuretics at present. Diagnostic paracentesis negative for 
infection. Ascitic total protein [REDACTED] so warrants SBP prophylaxis 
(<1.0) and fortunately already on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis 
which would be appropriate for SBP ppx also. Patient did admit 
to eating pizza and some [REDACTED] food prior to 
admission. She had therapeutic paracentesis with [REDACTED]and received 37.5G albumin IV post procedure. She felt much 
better with resolution of abdominal discomfort. Patient is 
scheduled for repeat paracentesis as outpatient on [REDACTED].  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. History of HE from Hep C cirrhosis. 
Now with mild encephalopathy (hallucinations and forgetfulness) 
due to medication noncompliance, but not acutely encephalopathic 
and without asterixis on exam. Infectious workup negative thus 
far. Continue lactulose 30mL TID and titrate to [REDACTED] BMs [REDACTED] and 
continue rifaximin [REDACTED] BID. 
 
# HYPONATREMIA. Na [REDACTED] on admission, [REDACTED], and [REDACTED]. Likely due to [REDACTED] spacing from worsening 
ascites and fluid overload. [REDACTED] therapeutic paracentesis with albumin replacement.

# CIRRHOSIS, HEPATITIS C. MELD score of [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] Pugh 
class B on this admission. Now decompensated due to ascites. 
Hepatitis C genotype IIIB. Dr. [REDACTED] starting 
sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with patient in clinic and the 
insurance process was started by her office. No history of EGD, 
needs this as outpatient for varices screening.  
 
# NUTRITION. Unclear if truly compliant with low salt diet. Poor 
oral intake. Low albumin [REDACTED] on admission. Met with nutrition. 
 
# COAGULOPATHY. INR [REDACTED]. No evidence of active 
bleeding. Very mild thrombocytopenia with plts [REDACTED].  
 
# HIV. Most recent CD4 [REDACTED]. On HAART. No established ID 
provider. Continue [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], [REDACTED] DS [REDACTED] for 
PCP prophylaxis. Needs outpatient ID appointment  

# COPD. Stable. States she is on intermittent home O2 for 
comfort at night and with abdominal distentiom. Continued home 
COPD meds and home O2 as needed 

**Transitional Issues**
- Discontinued spironolactone due to elevated potassium
- Increased furosemide to [REDACTED]
- Please recheck electrolytes at next visit
- Had paracentesis 06/28/2180 with 4.3 L removed, received [REDACTED]G 
albumin

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. [REDACTED] is a 46-year-old female with HIV on HAART, COPD, HCV 
cirrhosis complicated by ascites and hepatic encephalopathy who 
initially presented to the ED [REDACTED] with hypotension after a 
paracentesis.  
The patient has had accelerated decompensation of her cirrhosis 
recently with worsening ascites, and she is maintained on [REDACTED] paracentesis. She was at her regular session [REDACTED] 
when she had hypotension to SBP [REDACTED] and felt lightheadedness. 
Per the patient, that's when her memory started to get fuzzy. 
She does not have much recollection of what happened since then. 
Her outpatient hepatologist saw her and recommended that she go 
to the ED. In the ED, she was evaluated and deemed to have 
stable blood pressure. She was discharged home. At home, she had 
worsening mental status with her daughter getting concerned, and 
she returned to the ED.  
In the ED, initial vitals were [REDACTED] RA. The 
patient was only oriented to person. Her labs were notable for 
Na [REDACTED], K [REDACTED], Cr [REDACTED] (baseline [REDACTED]), ALT [REDACTED], AST [REDACTED], TBili 
[REDACTED], Lip [REDACTED], INR [REDACTED]. Initial EKG showed sinus rhythm with 
peaked T waves. Her head CT was negative for any acute 
processes. She received ceftriaxone 2gm x1, regular insulin 10U, 
calcium gluconate [REDACTED]g, lactulose [REDACTED] x2, and [REDACTED] albumin.  
On transfer, vitals were [REDACTED] 84/40 [REDACTED] NC. On arrival to 
the MICU, patient was more alert and conversant. She has no 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or difficulty 
breathing. She has a chronic cough that is not much changed. She 
has not had any fever or chills. She reports taking all of her 
medications except for lactulose, which she thinks taste

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a left valgus impacted femoral neck fracture and was 
admitted to the orthopedic surgery service. The patient was 
taken to the operating room on [REDACTED] for left closed reduction 
and percutaneous pinning of hip, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home medications were 
continued throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked 
with physical therapy who determined that discharge to home with services was 
appropriate. The post-operative hospital course was otherwise 
unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is  
weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity, and will 
be discharged on [REDACTED] for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. [REDACTED] routine. A thorough discussion 
was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [REDACTED] is a [REDACTED] male with history of factor VIII deficiency who 
presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. 
The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of 
consciousness on [REDACTED]. He was initially seen at 
[REDACTED] where CT imaging of head/neck showed no 
intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right 
platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active 
contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also 
developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain 
films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by BMC 
[REDACTED] and gave him [REDACTED] dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII 
assay was [REDACTED] and vW level was [REDACTED] per report. Per report, his 
hemoglobin decreased from [REDACTED] on [REDACTED] to [REDACTED] on [REDACTED]. 
Repeat imaging in [REDACTED] showed stable injuries. The 
patient saw his hematologist on [REDACTED] and was found to have a 
hemoglobin of [REDACTED]. Because of the continued mild decrease, the 
patient followed up with his PCP Dr. [REDACTED] on [REDACTED] at which time his 
hemoglobin was [REDACTED]. He was found to have an enlarging flank 
hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal 
bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally 
intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or 
palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of 
[REDACTED]. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder ([REDACTED] 
resting, [REDACTED] moving), though this has improved over the course 
of [REDACTED].  
In the ED, initial vital signs were [REDACTED] 124/75 18 100%/RA. 
Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin [REDACTED], though repeat was 
[REDACTED]. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 
[REDACTED]. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage 
along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary 
read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. [REDACTED], was 
contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 
0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher 
management.  
Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant 
bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. 
Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. 
He was tested and found to have von Willebrand disease. Later, 
after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late 
(e.g. [REDACTED]) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The 
patient was retested by a hematologist associated with [REDACTED] and was diagnosed 
with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on 
multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been [REDACTED].  
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without 
complaint.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
 
11/29/2192 CT A/P
Acute hemorrhage along right posterior flank musculature and 
probably layering over it, only partly imaged and hard to 
distinguish musculature from hemorrhage. No active extravasation 
seen. Probable old hematoma along posterior left flank. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [REDACTED] is a [REDACTED] male with history of mild FVIII deficiency who 
presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and 
falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding.

# FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY, MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented 
after recent snowboarding accident. At [REDACTED] neck and shoulder hematomas. 
Upon reevaluation by his PCP, the patient was found to have a 
flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin, there was concern for 
retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over 
his flank musculature, but no active extravasation. He was given 
IV DDAVP, but FVIII activity was [REDACTED] (wnl). CBC remained stable 
and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius 
hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin 
monitoring, but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given 
normal FVIII level.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. [REDACTED],

It was our pleasure caring for you at [REDACTED]Hospital. You were admitted with bruising on your right 
side and low blood counts after a snowboarding fall. With your 
history of hemophilia, it was important to evaluate internal 
bleeding which did show a right muscular flank blood collection. 
Your facotr VIII level was [REDACTED] and you received IV DDAVP under 
our care. Your blood counts were stable to improved on [REDACTED] 
of admission. 

It is important that you not participate in any dangerous 
activities given your recent bleed and your hemophilia. Bleeding 
in hemophiliacs has more potential to be life-threatening.

Please get your blood counts checked at [REDACTED] site on either 
[REDACTED] or [REDACTED]. Follow up with your 
regular doctor [REDACTED].

History of Present Illness:
Mr. [REDACTED] is a [REDACTED] male with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents 
upon transfer from outside hospital with nasal fractures and 
epistaxis secondary to fall. The patient reports that he was at 
[REDACTED]. While coughing, he tripped 
on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of 
consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and 
appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred 
to [REDACTED] for further care. There, a CT scan of 
the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and 
septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral 
RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge 
of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. 
While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up 
some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was 
noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a 
brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his 
baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his 
head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event 
confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic 
changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient 
was transferred for further care.

In the ED, initial vital signs [REDACTED] notable for WBC [REDACTED] (91%N), H/H [REDACTED], plt [REDACTED], BUN/Cr 
[REDACTED]. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was 
negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left 
lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing 
pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate 
for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and 
metoprolol tartrate [REDACTED]. Clopidogrel was held.

PA and lateral views of the chest provided. The lungs are 
adequately 
aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base 
adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular 
engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch 
calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. 

10/19/2132 ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical 
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = [REDACTED]%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are [REDACTED] aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area [REDACTED]). Mild ([REDACTED]+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD 
distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. [REDACTED] is a [REDACTED] male with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who 
presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical 
fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.

#Epistaxis, nasal fractures
Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets 
placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from 
that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The 
Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued 
prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal 
spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. 

#NSTEMI
Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This 
was trended and eventually rose to [REDACTED], though MB component 
downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without 
chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted 
who thought that this was most likely [REDACTED] to demand 
ischemia (type II MI) [REDACTED] to his fall. An echocardiogram 
demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based 
on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was 
uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his 
clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.

#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation
Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he 
maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied 
shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious 
symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation 
in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. 
-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered 
with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for 
the [REDACTED], but this was discontinued upon discharge.

#Acute kidney injury
Patient presented with creatinine of [REDACTED] with last creatinine at 
PCP [REDACTED]. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The 
patient was discharged with a stable creatinine.

#Peripheral vascular disease
Patient had a history of AAA repair in [REDACTED] without history of 
MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral 
stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease 
(possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). 
-Repeat echocardiogram in [REDACTED] to monitor mild AS/AR.
-If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray.
-Repeat chest x-ray in [REDACTED] to ensure resolution of the LLL 
infiltrative process.
-Consider follow-up with ENT or [REDACTED] for later 
evaluation of nasal fractures.
-Repeat CBC in [REDACTED] to ensure stability of HCT and 
platelets.
-Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for 
ease-of-administration.
