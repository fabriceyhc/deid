Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Santos,
It was a pleasure taking care of you! You came to us with 
stomach pain and worsening distension. While you were here we 
did a paracentesis to remove 1.5L of fluid from your belly. We 
also placed you on you 40 mg of Lasix and 50 mg of Aldactone to 
help you urinate the excess fluid still in your belly. As we 
discussed, everyone has a different dose of lasix required to 
make them urinate and it's likely that you weren't taking a high 
enough dose. Please take these medications daily to keep excess 
fluid off and eat a low salt diet. You will follow up with Dr. 
Maria Gonzalez in liver clinic and from there have your colonoscopy 
and EGD scheduled. Of course, we are always here if you need us. 
We wish you all the best!
Your Massachusetts General Hospital Team.  
 
Followup Instructions:

1. Extremely coarse and nodular liver echotexture consistent 
with a history of cirrhosis.  
2. Moderate ascites.  
3. Patent portal vein.
 
Brief Hospital Course:
46-year-old female with HIV on HAART, HCV cirrhosis with ascites and HE, h/o 
IVDU, COPD, bipolar disorder presents with abdominal discomfort 
due to recurrent ascites.  
 
# ASCITES. Now diuretic refractory given last tap was three days 
ago with 3L removed and she has already built up moderate 
ascites. Infectious workup negative, with CXR clear, UA 
contaminated but not grossly positive so will f/u culture, 
diagnostic para with only 225 WBC, RUQ US with no PV thrombus. 
Compliant with diuretics but not following low sodium diet or 
fluid restriction. Dr. Maria Gonzalez discussed possible TIPS in 
the office but due to lung disease, that was on hold pending 
further cardiac evaluation. Diuretics were recently decreased 
due to hyponatremia and hyperkalemia. Held spironolactone for 
now due to K 5.2 and increased lasix 20 -> 40. No evidence of 
severe hyponatremia (Na<120) or renal failure Cr>2.0 to stop 
diuretics at present. Diagnostic paracentesis negative for 
infection. Ascitic total protein 0.3 so warrants SBP prophylaxis 
(<1.0) and fortunately already on Bactrim for PCP prophylaxis 
which would be appropriate for SBP ppx also. Patient did admit 
to eating pizza and some Chinese food prior to 
admission. She had therapeutic paracentesis with 4.3L removed 
and received 37.5G albumin IV post procedure. She felt much 
better with resolution of abdominal discomfort. Patient is 
scheduled for repeat paracentesis as outpatient on 07/05/2180.  

# HEPATIC ENCEPHALOPATHY. History of HE from Hep C cirrhosis. 
Now with mild encephalopathy (hallucinations and forgetfulness) 
due to medication noncompliance, but not acutely encephalopathic 
and without asterixis on exam. Infectious workup negative thus 
far. Continue lactulose 30mL TID and titrate to 3 BMs daily and 
continue rifaximin 550mg BID. 
 
# HYPONATREMIA. Na 125 on admission, 128 four days ago, and 135 
one month ago. Likely due to third spacing from worsening 
ascites and fluid overload. 1.5L fluid restriction, low salt 
diet. S/p therapeutic paracentesis with albumin replacement.

# CIRRHOSIS, HEPATITIS C. MELD score of 10 and Child's Pugh 
class B on this admission. Now decompensated due to ascites. 
Hepatitis C genotype IIIB. Dr. Maria Gonzalez starting 
sofosbuvir and velpatasvir with patient in clinic and the 
insurance process was started by her office. No history of EGD, 
needs this as outpatient for varices screening.  
 
# NUTRITION. Unclear if truly compliant with low salt diet. Poor 
oral intake. Low albumin 2.8 on admission. Met with nutrition. 
 
# COAGULOPATHY. INR 1.4 four days ago. No evidence of active 
bleeding. Very mild thrombocytopenia with plts 143.  
 
# HIV. Most recent CD4 173. On HAART. No established ID 
provider. Continue Truvada and Isentress, Bactrim DS daily for 
PCP prophylaxis. Needs outpatient ID appointment  

# COPD. Stable. States she is on intermittent home O2 for 
comfort at night and with abdominal distentiom. Continued home 
COPD meds and home O2 as needed 

**Transitional Issues**
- Discontinued spironolactone due to elevated potassium
- Increased furosemide to 40mg daily
- Please recheck electrolytes at next visit
- Had paracentesis 06/28/2180 with 4.3 L removed, received 37.5G 
albumin
- Needs outpatient ID provider
- Patient needs more frequent paracentesis

Discharge Instructions:
Dear Ms. Santos,

It was a pleasure to take care of you at Massachusetts General Hospital 
Medical Center. You were admitted with abdominal fullness and 
pain from your ascites. You had a diagnostic and therapeutic 
paracentesis with 4.3 L removed. Your spironolactone was 
discontinued because your potassium was high. Your lasix was 
increased to 40mg daily. You are scheduled for another 
paracentesis on 07/05/2180 prior to your other appointments that day. 
Please call tomorrow to find out the time of the paracentesis. 
Please continue to follow a low sodium diet and fluid 
restriction. You should call your liver doctor or return to the 
emergency room if you have abdominal pain, fever, chills, 
confusion, or other concerning symptoms.

Sincerely,
Your Massachusetts General Hospital medical team

History of Present Illness:
Mrs. Santos is a 46-year-old female with HIV on HAART, COPD, HCV 
cirrhosis complicated by ascites and hepatic encephalopathy who 
initially presented to the ED yesterday with hypotension after a 
paracentesis.  
The patient has had accelerated decompensation of her cirrhosis 
recently with worsening ascites, and she is maintained on twice 
weekly paracentesis. She was at her regular session yesterday 
when she had hypotension to SBP 85/45 and felt lightheadedness. 
Per the patient, that's when her memory started to get fuzzy. 
She does not have much recollection of what happened since then. 
Her outpatient hepatologist saw her and recommended that she go 
to the ED. In the ED, she was evaluated and deemed to have 
stable blood pressure. She was discharged home. At home, she had 
worsening mental status with her daughter getting concerned, and 
she returned to the ED.  
In the ED, initial vitals were 98.7 77 96/50 16 98% RA. The 
patient was only oriented to person. Her labs were notable for 
Na 126, K 6.7, Cr 0.7 (baseline 0.4), ALT 153, AST 275, TBili 
1.9, Lip 66, INR 1.5. Initial EKG showed sinus rhythm with 
peaked T waves. Her head CT was negative for any acute 
processes. She received ceftriaxone 2gm x1, regular insulin 10U, 
calcium gluconate 1g, lactulose 30 mL x2, and 25g 5% albumin.  
On transfer, vitals were 99.0 93 84/40 16 95% NC. On arrival to 
the MICU, patient was more alert and conversant. She has no 
abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chest pain, or difficulty 
breathing. She has a chronic cough that is not much changed. She 
has not had any fever or chills. She reports taking all of her 
medications except for lactulose, which she thinks taste 
disgusting.

Brief Hospital Course:
The patient presented to the emergency department and was 
evaluated by the orthopedic surgery team. The patient was found 
to have a left valgus impacted femoral neck fracture and was 
admitted to the orthopedic surgery service. The patient was 
taken to the operating room on 09/21/2183 for left closed reduction 
and percutaneous pinning of hip, which the patient tolerated 
well. For full details of the procedure please see the 
separately dictated operative report. The patient was taken from 
the OR to the PACU in stable condition and after satisfactory 
recovery from anesthesia was transferred to the floor. The 
patient was initially given IV fluids and IV pain medications, 
and progressed to a regular diet and oral medications by POD#1. 
The patient was given prophylactic antibiotics and 
anticoagulation per routine. The patient's home medications were 
continued throughout this hospitalization. The patient worked 
with physical therapy who determined that discharge to home with services was 
appropriate. The post-operative hospital course was otherwise 
unremarkable.

At the time of discharge the patient's pain was well controlled 
with oral medications, incisions were clean/dry/intact, and the 
patient was voiding/moving bowels spontaneously. The patient is  
weightbearing as tolerated in the left lower extremity, and will 
be discharged on Lovenox for DVT prophylaxis. The patient will 
follow up with Dr. Michael Thompson routine. A thorough discussion 
was had with the patient regarding the diagnosis and expected 
post-discharge course including reasons to call the office or 
return to the hospital, and all questions were answered. The 
patient was also given written instructions concerning 
precautionary instructions and the appropriate follow-up care. 
The patient expressed readiness for discharge.

Discharge Instructions:
INSTRUCTIONS AFTER ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY:

- You were in the hospital for orthopedic surgery. It is normal 
to feel tired or ""washed out"" after surgery, and this feeling 
should improve over the first few days to week. 
- Resume your regular activities as tolerated, but please follow 
your weight bearing precautions strictly at all times.

ACTIVITY AND WEIGHT BEARING:
- Weightbearing as tolerated left lower extremity

MEDICATIONS:
  1)  Take Tylenol 1000mg every 6 hours around the clock. This is 
an over the counter medication.
  2)  Add oxycodone as needed for increased pain. Aim to wean 
off this medication in 1 week or sooner.  This is an example on 
how to wean down:
Take 1 tablet every 3 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 4 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 6 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every 8 hours as needed x 2 days, 
then 1 tablet every 12 hours as needed x 1 day,
then 1 tablet every before bedtime as needed x 1 day.  
Then continue with Tylenol for pain.
  3)  Do not stop the Tylenol until you are off of the narcotic 
medication.
  4)  Per state regulations, we are limited in the amount of 
narcotics we can prescribe. If you require more, you must 
contact the office to set up an appointment because we cannot 
refill this type of pain medication over the phone. 
  5)  Narcotic pain relievers can cause constipation, so you 
should drink eight 8oz glasses of water daily and continue 
following the bowel regimen as stated on your medication 
prescription list. These meds (senna, colace, miralax) are over 
the counter and may be obtained at any pharmacy.
  6)  Do not drink alcohol, drive a motor vehicle, or operate 
machinery while taking narcotic pain relievers.
  7)  Please take all medications as prescribed by your 
physicians at discharge.
  8)  Continue all home medications unless specifically 
instructed to stop by your surgeon.
      
ANTICOAGULATION:
- Please take  Lovenox daily for 4 weeks

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure:
None

 
History of Present Illness:
Mr. Rodriguez is a 27-year-old male with history of factor VIII deficiency who 
presents with right neck swelling after snowboarding accident. 
The patient reports that he fell while snowboarding with loss of 
consciousness on 11/28/2192. He was initially seen at 
Boston Medical Center where CT imaging of head/neck showed no 
intracranial hemorrhage. A CTA neck showed a thickened right 
platysma muscle with surrounding hematoma and a focus of active 
contrast extravasation within the right platysma muscle. He also 
developed a right shoulder hematoma although shoulder plain 
films didn't show acute abnormality. He was seen by BMC 
Hematology and gave him one dose of DDAVP IV. A factor VIII 
assay was 139 and vW level was >200 per report. Per report, his 
hemoglobin decreased from 13.2 on 11/28/2192 to 11.6 on 11/29/2192. 
Repeat imaging in the morning showed stable injuries. The 
patient saw his hematologist on 11/29/2192 and was found to have a 
hemoglobin of 10.4. Because of the continued mild decrease, the 
patient followed up with his PCP Dr. James Wilson on 11/29/2192 at which time his 
hemoglobin was 9.9. He was found to have an enlarging flank 
hematoma, thus was referred given concern for retroperitoneal 
bleed. The patient has been using DDAVP intranasally 
intermittently since the accident. He denies lightheadedness or 
palpitations, any increase in neck swelling over the course of 
the week. He does endorse pain in his right shoulder (4/10 
resting, 7/10 moving), though this has improved over the course 
of the week.  
In the ED, initial vital signs were 99.2 87 124/75 18 100%/RA. 
Initial labs demonstrated hemoglobin 10.6, though repeat was 
9.7. Chemistries and coags were unremarkable. FVIII activity was 
103. A CTAP was performed which demonstrated muscular hemorrhage 
along the flank, but no retroperitoneal bleed on preliminary 
read. The patient's outpatient hematologist, Dr. Sarah Kim, was 
contacted and it was decided to give the patient desmopressin 
0.3mg/kg IV. The patient was then admitted for futher 
management.  
Per review of records, the patient has a history of significant 
bleeding after his circumcision, requiring blood transfusion. 
Throughout childhood, he also had a tendency to bruise easily. 
He was tested and found to have von Willebrand disease. Later, 
after wisdom tooth extraction, the patient experienced late 
(e.g. 5 days later) bleeding despite treatment with DDAVP. The 
patient was retested by a hematologist associated with the 
Massachusetts General Hospital and was diagnosed 
with hemophilia A. His FVIII activity has been checked on 
multiple occasions, sometimes testing normal, though has been as 
low as ~50.  
Upon arrival to the floor, the patient is comfortable without 
complaint.

IMAGING/STUDIES:
 
11/29/2192 CT A/P
Acute hemorrhage along right posterior flank musculature and 
probably layering over it, only partly imaged and hard to 
distinguish musculature from hemorrhage. No active extravasation 
seen. Probable old hematoma along posterior left flank. 

 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Rodriguez is a 27-year-old male with history of mild FVIII deficiency who 
presents after snowboarding accident with multiple hematomas and 
falling hemoglobin concerning for ongoing bleeding.

# FACTOR VIII DEFICIENCY, MULTIPLE HEMATOMAS: Patient presented 
after recent snowboarding accident. At Boston Medical Center 
on 11/28/2192, imaging was notable for neck and shoulder hematomas. 
Upon reevaluation by his PCP, the patient was found to have a 
flank hematoma. Given falling hemoglobin, there was concern for 
retroperitoneal bleed. CTAP in the ED demonstrated hematoma over 
his flank musculature, but no active extravasation. He was given 
IV DDAVP, but FVIII activity was 103 (wnl). CBC remained stable 
and patient declined further inpatient monitoring. Atrius 
hematology recommended continued outpatient hemoglobin 
monitoring, but did not think further DDAVP was indicated given 
normal FVIII level.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Rodriguez,

It was our pleasure caring for you at Massachusetts General 
Hospital. You were admitted with bruising on your right 
side and low blood counts after a snowboarding fall. With your 
history of hemophilia, it was important to evaluate internal 
bleeding which did show a right muscular flank blood collection. 
Your facotr VIII level was 103 and you received IV DDAVP under 
our care. Your blood counts were stable to improved on the day 
of admission. 

It is important that you not participate in any dangerous 
activities given your recent bleed and your hemophilia. Bleeding 
in hemophiliacs has more potential to be life-threatening.

Please get your blood counts checked at MGH Lab site on either 
12/02/2192 or 12/03/2192. Follow up with your 
regular doctor early next week.

Best wishes,
Your MGH Care Team

Brief Hospital Course:
Patient was admitted to Urology after undergoing laparoscopic 
right radical nephrectomy. No concerning intraoperative events 
occurred; please see dictated operative note for details. The 
patient received perioperative antibiotic prophylaxis. The 
patient was transferred to the floor from the PACU in stable 
condition.  On POD0, pain was well controlled on PCA, hydrated 
for urine output >30cc/hour, provided with pneumoboots and 
incentive spirometry for prophylaxis, and ambulated once. On 
POD1,foley was removed without difficulty, basic metabolic panel 
and complete blood count were checked, pain control was 
transitioned from PCA to oral analgesics, diet was advanced to a 
clears/toast and crackers diet. On POD2, diet was advanced as 
tolerated. The remainder of the hospital course was relatively 
unremarkable. The patient was discharged in stable condition, 
eating well, ambulating independently, voiding without 
difficulty, and with pain control on oral analgesics. On exam, 
incision was clean, dry, and intact, with no evidence of 
hematoma collection or infection. The patient was given explicit 
instructions to follow-up in clinic with Dr. Maria Lopez in 3 weeks.

History of Present Illness:
Mr. Kowalski is a 77-year-old male with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who presents 
upon transfer from outside hospital with nasal fractures and 
epistaxis secondary to fall. The patient reports that he was at 
the Boston Medical Center earlier this afternoon. While coughing, he tripped 
on the curb and suffered trauma to his face. He had no loss of 
consciousness. However, he had a persistent nosebleed and 
appeared to have some trauma to his face, thus was transferred 
to Massachusetts General Hospital for further care. There, a CT scan of 
the head, neck, and face were remarkable for a nasal bone and 
septal fracture. Given persistent epistaxis, bilateral 
RhinoRockets were placed. He had a small abrasion to the bridge 
of his nose which was not closed. Bleeding was well controlled. 
While in the OSH ED, he had an episode of nausea and coughed up 
some blood. At that time, he began to feel lightheaded and was 
noted to be hypotensive and bradycardic. Per report, he had a 
brief loss of consciousness, though quickly returned to his 
baseline. His family noted that his eyes rolled back into his 
head. The patient recalls the event and denies post-event 
confusion. He had no further episodes of syncope or hemodynamic 
changes.  Given the syncopal event and epistaxis, the patient 
was transferred for further care.

In the ED, initial vital signs 98.9 92 140/77 18 100%/RA. Labs 
were notable for WBC 11.3 (91%N), H/H 14.1/40.2, plt 147, BUN/Cr 
36/1.5. HCTs were repeated which were stable. A urinalysis was 
negative. A CXR demonstrated a focal consolidation at the left 
lung base, possibly representing aspiration or developing 
pneumonia. The patient was given Tdap, amoxicillin-clavulanate 
for antibiotic prophylaxis, ondansetron, 500cc NS, and 
metoprolol tartrate 50mg. Clopidogrel was held.
 
Past Medical History:
MI after AAA repair when he was 65 y/o
HTN
Hypercholesterolemia
 
Social History:
Lives in Dorchester with his wife. Retired postal worker. Former smoker, quit 15 years ago. No alcohol use. No illicit drugs. Walks 30 minutes daily for exercise.
Family History:
Patient is unaware of a family history of bleeding diathesis.

IMAGING:
10/18/2132 CXR
PA and lateral views of the chest provided. The lungs are 
adequately 
aerated. There is a focal consolidation at the left lung base 
adjacent to the lateral hemidiaphragm. There is mild vascular 
engorgement. There is bilateral apical pleural thickening. The 
cardiomediastinal silhouette is remarkable for aortic arch 
calcifications. The heart is top normal in size. 

10/19/2132 ECHO
The left atrium is mildly dilated. Left ventricular wall 
thicknesses and cavity size are normal. There is mild regional 
left ventricular systolic dysfunction with focal apical 
hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 55 
%). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Right 
ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. There 
are three aortic valve leaflets. There is mild aortic valve 
stenosis (valve area 1.7cm2). Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is 
seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial 
mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic 
pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic 
pericardial effusion. 

IMPRESSION: Normal left ventricular cavity size with mild 
regional systolic dysfunction most c/w CAD (distal LAD 
distribution). Mild aortic valve stenosis. Mild aortic 
regurgitation. 
 
Brief Hospital Course:
Mr. Kowalski is a 77-year-old male with history of AAA s/p repair 
complicated by MI, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia who 
presented with nasal fractures and epistaxis after mechanical 
fall with hospital course complicated by NSTEMI.

#Epistaxis, nasal fractures
Patient presenting after mechanical fall with Rhinorockets 
placed at outside hospital for ongoing epistaxis. CT scan from 
that hospital demonstrated nasal bone and septal fractures. The 
Rhinorockets were maintained while inpatient and discontinued 
prior to discharge. He was encouraged to use oxymetolazone nasal 
spray and hold pressure should bleeding reoccur. 

#NSTEMI
Patient found to have mild elevation of troponin in the ED. This 
was trended and eventually rose to 1.5, though MB component 
downtrended during course of admission. The patient was without 
chest pain or other cardiac symptoms. Cardiology was consulted 
who thought that this was most likely secondary to demand 
ischemia (type II MI) secondary to his fall. An echocardiogram 
demonstrated aortic stenosis and likely distal LAD disease based 
on wall motion abnormalities. The patient's metoprolol was 
uptitrated, his pravastatin was converted to atorvastatin, his 
clopidogrel was maintained, and he was started on aspirin.

#Hypoxemia/L basilar consolidation
Patient reported to be mildly hypoxic in the ED, though he 
maintained normal oxygen saturations on room air. He denied 
shortness of breath or cough, fevers, or other infectious 
symptoms and had no leukocytosis. A CXR revealed consolidation 
in left lung, thought to be possibly related to aspirated blood. 
-monitor O2 saturation, temperature, trend WBC. He was convered 
with antibiotics while inpatient as he required prophylaxis for 
the Rhinorockets, but this was discontinued upon discharge.

#Acute kidney injury
Patient presented with creatinine of 1.5 with last creatinine at 
PCP 1.8. Patient was unaware of a history of kidney disease. The 
patient was discharged with a stable creatinine.

#Peripheral vascular disease
Patient had a history of AAA repair in 2120 without history of 
MI per PCP. Patient denied history of CABG or cardiac/peripheral 
stents. A cardiac regimen was continued, as above.

TRANSITIONAL ISSUES
-Outpatient stress echo for futher evaluation distal LAD disease 
(possibly a large myocardial territory at risk). 
-Repeat echocardiogram in 2 years to monitor mild AS/AR.
-If epistaxis returns, can use oxymetolazone nasal spray.
-Repeat chest x-ray in 2 weeks to ensure resolution of the LLL 
infiltrative process.
-Consider follow-up with ENT or Plastic Surgery for later 
evaluation of nasal fractures.
-Repeat CBC in one week to ensure stability of HCT and 
platelets.
-Consider conversion of metoprolol tartrate to succinate for 
ease-of-administration.

Discharge Instructions:
Mr. Kowalski,
You were admitted after you fell and broke your nose. You had 
nose bleeds that were difficult to control, thus plugs were 
placed in your nose to stop the bleeding. During your hospital 
course, you were found to have high troponins, a blood test for 
the heart. A ultrasound of your heart was performed. You should 
follow-up with your PCP to discuss stress test.

It was a pleasure participating in your care, thank you for 
choosing Massachusetts General Hospital.
